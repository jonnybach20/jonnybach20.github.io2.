							<h1><span>Planning Research and Monitoring Information</span></h1>
							<p>I took interest in the planned environment in my Masters degree, as such, my <a href="WfW-Dissertation-Project.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Master's dissertation</b></a> was an analysis of Welsh afforestation policy's ability to satisfy current government targets. I believe the research skills I gained in my studies provided me the foundation to develop my planning research skills in my current role.</span></p>
                            <p>I have supported the preparation of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority's strategic plans by producing quality planning research. Here are some examples of documents I have put together for my Strategic Policy Manager which have been used to inform draft Supplementary Planning Guidance, such as SPGs for <a href="Replacement Dwellings.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Replacement Dwellings</b></a>, the <a href="Energy efficient conversions.pdf" target="_blank"><b>retrofit</b></a> of energy generation items, and <a href="Renovate vs. rebuild.pdf" target="_blank"><b>robust future life of dwellings</b></a>.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, as a County with high percentage areas of second homes and holiday lets, my Manager has been considering the inclusion of a <a href="Principal Residence_Local Connection.pdf" target="_blank"><b>principal residency policy</b></a> in the next Local Development Plan.</p>
						    <p>Regarding monitoring information, the PCNPA presents an annual monitoring report to the Welsh Government to monitor the National Park's performance and development. As Technical Support Officer, I was responsible for organising the public consultation of the Annual Monitoring Report, organising representations into a report for Officers to comment on. Once edits were agreed at commitee, I formatted the edits to produce the final Annual Monitoring Report. I was also involved in the monitoring activity, undertaking onsite survey work to monitor changes in the community in respect to retail and community facilities. </p>
